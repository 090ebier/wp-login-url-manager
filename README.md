# WordPress Custom Login URL Script Manager  

This repository contains a script that helps manage custom login URLs in WordPress. It allows administrators to add or remove PHP code in the `functions.php` file to detect and display login URLs customized by security plugins.  

## Features  
- âœ… Add custom login URLs to the `functions.php` file.  
- âœ… Remove custom login URLs from the `functions.php` file.  
- âœ… Prevent duplicate additions of the same code.  
- âœ… Quickly find custom login URLs using the `find_login_url` parameter.  

## Usage  

### 1. Adding the Script to `functions.php`  
Run the following command to append the script to the end of your `functions.php` file:  
```bash
bash wp-login-url-manager.sh /path/to/your/theme/functions.php add
```
OR
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/090ebier/wp-login-url-manager/refs/heads/main/wp-login-url-manager.sh) /path/to/your/theme/functions.php add
```

If the script already exists, it will not be added again.  

### 2. Removing the Script from `functions.php`  
To remove the script, use:  
```bash
bash wp-login-url-manager.sh /path/to/your/theme/functions.php del
```

bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/090ebier/wp-login-url-manager/refs/heads/main/wp-login-url-manager.sh) /path/to/your/theme/functions.php del
```
If the script is not found, an error message will be displayed.
